## Usage Instructions

1. **Define the specific problem**: Be clear about what needs creative solution
2. **Use the template**: Copy into GitHub Copilot Chat
3. **Iterate on ideas**: Ask Copilot to generate multiple approaches
4. **Evaluate systematically**: Use the scoring matrix
5. **Document decisions**: Record rationale for future reference
6. **Create prototypes**: Test key assumptions early

## When to Use CREATIVE Mode

- **Complex design decisions** that have multiple valid approaches
- **User experience challenges** requiring innovative solutions
- **Technical architecture** with various implementation options
- **Novel features** without established patterns
- **Integration problems** needing creative workarounds
- **Performance optimization** requiring innovative approaches

## Expected Outputs

- **Multiple solution approaches** with detailed analysis
- **Systematic evaluation** of options
- **Clear design decisions** with documented rationale
- **Implementation roadmap** from creative concept to working code
- **Prototype specifications** for validation
- **Design documentation** for future reference

## Next Steps

After CREATIVE mode:
- **Move to IMPLEMENT mode** to build the chosen solution
- **Create prototypes** to validate key assumptions
- **Update the PLAN** with any architecture changes
- **Document decisions** for the team

## Tips for Creative Success

- **Think beyond obvious solutions**: Explore unconventional approaches
- **Consider user perspective**: How will people actually use this?
- **Balance innovation with practicality**: Cool ideas must be buildable
- **Document the process**: Record why decisions were made
- **Prototype early**: Test assumptions before full implementation
- **Stay flexible**: Be ready to adapt as you learn more

## Usage Instructions

1. **Complete after implementation**: Use when you've finished a significant piece of work
2. **Be thorough and honest**: Include both successes and challenges
3. **Focus on learning**: Emphasize insights that will help future work
4. **Document for the team**: Make sure findings are accessible to others
5. **Plan improvements**: Turn insights into actionable next steps

## When to Use REFLECT Mode

- **After completing features**: At the end of major development milestones
- **End of sprints**: Regular review of iterative development cycles
- **Post-problem solving**: After resolving significant technical challenges
- **Before major changes**: Prior to shifting focus or approach
- **Team retrospectives**: As input for team reflection meetings

## Expected Outputs

- **Comprehensive review** of completed work
- **Documented lessons learned** for future reference
- **Improvement opportunities** with actionable recommendations
- **Technical debt assessment** with prioritized action plan
- **Future guidance** for upcoming development work
- **Knowledge preservation** for team and organizational learning

## Reflection Categories

### Technical Reflection
- Code quality and architecture decisions
- Performance and scalability considerations

- **Plan improvements** for future development cycles
- **Move to ARCHIVE mode** for comprehensive documentation (Level 3-4 projects)
- **Begin next VAN cycle** for new features or projects

## Tips for Effective Reflection

- **Be specific**: Vague observations don't help future work
- **Include context**: Explain why things happened, not just what happened
- **Balance positive and negative**: Acknowledge both successes and failures
- **Think long-term**: Consider how insights apply to future projects
- **Make it actionable**: Turn observations into concrete recommendations
- **Collaborate**: Include perspectives from other team members

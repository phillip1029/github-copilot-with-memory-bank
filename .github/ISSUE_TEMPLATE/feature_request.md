# Feature Request - Memory Bank Analysis

## üìã Feature Overview
**Brief description of the feature:**
<!-- Describe what you want to be built -->

**Problem this solves:**
<!-- Explain what problem this feature addresses -->

**Expected outcome:**
<!-- Describe what success looks like -->

---

## üîç VAN Analysis Required

Before implementation, this feature needs VAN (Validation & Analysis) mode analysis:

### Initial Complexity Assessment
**Estimated Complexity Level:**
- [ ] Level 1 (Simple) - Basic functionality, minimal dependencies
- [ ] Level 2 (Moderate) - Multiple components, some integration
- [ ] Level 3 (Complex) - Advanced features, multiple integrations  
- [ ] Level 4 (Enterprise) - Large-scale, multiple systems

### Technology Impact
**Components affected:**
<!-- List what parts of the system this will touch -->

**Dependencies required:**
<!-- New libraries, services, or external integrations needed -->

**Integration points:**
<!-- How this connects to existing systems -->
